## About Me :wave:

My goal for this year is to attend more ETH events, meet innovators in this space and to find a job as a software/smart contract engineer in a cutting-edge company within the Ethereum ecosystem :computer:

My hobbies include kayaking :rowboat: surfing :surfing_man: and running :runner:
